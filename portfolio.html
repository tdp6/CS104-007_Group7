        <p style="color:green">I am a first year architecture student at NJIT and am apart of the five year program. I chose architecture because of my love of art and being creative. I grew up in New Jersey an hour south of newark along the shore. The beach is one of my favorite places. <br> Along with art I love music and enjoy going to shows and concerts a lot. I hope to get a lot out of my five years here and am excited to learn more about my major. </p>
