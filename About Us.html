    <p id="About">
            The creators of the Studio Time Tracker are a group of architecture students who were interested in finding out how long 
            they each spent one various projects inside of the studio space. These students banded together to form a site that could 
            track and display these times in order to better understand how to improve the experience in studio and the work/life 
            balance around studio time.
